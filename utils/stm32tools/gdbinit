## Example GDB script for loading a bootloader binary using OpenOCD

# Set target binary and connect to OpenOCD
file "./bootloader.elf"
target extended-remote localhost:3333

# Reset target and flush register cache since GDB is apparently
# not smart enough to do this itself.
monitor reset halt
maintenance flush register-cache

# Download binary to target
load "./bootloader.elf"
