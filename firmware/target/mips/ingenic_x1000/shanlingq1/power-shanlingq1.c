/* TODO: Better(?) battery reporting for Q1 using CW2015 driver
 *
 * The CW2015 has its own quirks so the driver has to be more complicated
 * than "read stuff from I2C," unfortunately. Without fixing the quirks it
 * is probably worse than the simple voltage-based method.
 *
 * A bigger problem is that it shares an I2C bus with the AXP192, but when
 * we attempt to communicate with both chips, they start returning bogus
 * data intermittently. Ususally, reads will return 0 but sometimes they
 * can return other nonzero bogus data. It could be that one or the other is
 * pulling the bus line down inappropriately, or maybe the hardware does not
 * respect the bus free time between start/stop conditions and one of the
 * devices is getting confused.
