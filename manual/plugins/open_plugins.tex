\subsection{OpenPlugins}
\setting{Rockbox} uses an on disk database to store plugins and parameters.
\setting{OpenPlugins} allows viewing/editing/exporting items from this database.

\subsubsection{How it works}
\setting{OpenPlugins} displays a list of plugins you have set for actions such
as your \setting{Wps Hotkey}, \setting{Wps Context Plugin}, or \setting{Startup Plugin}.
You can export these entries or your own custom entries to a shortcut.
Any time this shortcut is run your selected parameters (or file) will be supplied.

If no items currently exist there will only be a single item 'Add',
on selection you will be presented with the file browser choose a plugin.

After selecting a plugin you will have a new entry long press on an entry will 
display the context menu where you can edit the name,
add parameters or even remove the entry.
