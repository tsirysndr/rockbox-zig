\subsection{Multiboot Select}
The \setting{Multiboot Select} plugin allows you to select from multiple
versions of rockbox on devices that support it.

\subsubsection{How it works}
Normally your \setting{Rockbox} install lives in the root of your main drive
On devices with multiboot your rockbox install can live in a separate folder
\opt{multidrive_usb}{on the external drive}.

Once several installs exist, \setting{Multiboot Select} will allow you to
select them for next boot or even reboot with your selected install immediately.

\subsubsection{Menu}

\item[Save and Exit] Saves the currently selected install to be run next boot.
\item[Save and Reboot] Saves the currently selected install and reboots immediately.
\item[Save and Exit] Exit without saving changes.
